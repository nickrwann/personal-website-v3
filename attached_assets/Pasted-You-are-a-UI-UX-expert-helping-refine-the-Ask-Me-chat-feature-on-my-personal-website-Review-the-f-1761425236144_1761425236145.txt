You are a UI/UX expert helping refine the "Ask Me" chat feature on my personal website. Review the following instructions and implement them with best design practices in mind. Be opinionated about what makes for optimal usability, clarity, and polish.

Goals:
1. Improve the chat feature's visibility, interactivity, and smoothness.
2. Keep the design minimalistic and elegant—avoid a salesy or intrusive look.
3. Maintain the current circular "Ask" icon aesthetic unless there’s a strong design reason to improve it.

Detailed instructions:

• Scroll behavior:
  - Make scrolling smoother and more fluid if possible.
  - If that adds unnecessary complexity or performance cost, leave it as-is.

• Chat icon behavior:
  - The current icon is good—clean, minimal, circular.
  - Make the icon sticky so it remains visible as the user scrolls, similar to the light/dark mode toggle.
  - Ensure the icon elegantly overlays page content without blocking it.

• Visibility and prompting:
  - Add clearer call-to-action text near or inside the icon to invite engagement. Examples:
    - “Ask me a question”
    - “Chat with me”
    - “Ask!”
    - “Talk to me”
  - Choose whichever phrasing fits the overall aesthetic best; lean toward concise and friendly language.
  - If needed, consider alternate widget styles (for example, a small rounded rectangle instead of a circle) but only if it improves clarity without feeling like a sales chatbot.

• Behavior when clicked:
  - When opened, the chat feature should clearly communicate its purpose—asking questions about me.
  - Include a small header or text like “Ask about Nick” or “Ask my assistant about me.”
  - Provide three example prompts inside the chat window (before user input):
      1. “Why should I hire Nick?”
      2. “What is Nick best at?”
      3. “What does Nick like to do in his free time?”
  - Keep the examples conversational and first-person oriented (as if the visitor is asking an assistant about me).

• Input behavior:
  - Retain the placeholder text (e.g., “Ask a question about Nick...”).
  - Ensure the input text box expands dynamically as the user types longer questions.

Final notes:
- Preserve the minimalist design aesthetic of the site.
- Avoid intrusive or animated elements that distract from the main content.
- Prioritize balance between subtle presence and discoverability—users should notice the chat feature naturally without being interrupted.
